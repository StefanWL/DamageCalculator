# DamageCalculator
Live Site is available at: pokemondamagecalculator.rf.gd

Damage calculator that's written primarily in vanilla JavaScript.
Users are able to enter and save their own teams through text or by URL.

After starting a match enemies are added by typing their names in to the autocomplete across the top of the page.
Up to six enemies can be chosen at a time.
Damage is calculated by calculating the final stats the user's inputted teams and comparing it to common stats and moves the enemies can have.
Output is appended directly to the DOM as HTML nodes.
